KeyFinder - PoC ETH & BSC generator

KeyFinder is an ETH & BSC private key generator with high speed and efficient balance checking.

This software has been coded for fun and without any real intent, if not studying the generation, importation and validation of private keys in the ETH-based blockchains.

Despite being less likeable than being bited by a flying pig in the middle of the ocean, there is still a small chance of generating an active wallet, maybe with balance. That's why KeyFinder check balances of the random generated addresses.

NOTE: By default, KeyFinder will spawn 200 threads to maximize CPU time. Pay attention to the resources!
